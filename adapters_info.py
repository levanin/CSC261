"""Moss cannot live without his laptop. His laptop cannot live long without its charger. When travelling overseas,
he sometimes needs to use a plug adapter to be able to plug the charger in. Sometimes he even has to create a chain of
these adapters.
For example if his charger plug is of type A and he needs to plug it into a socket of type C, he can use two adapters AB
and BC to plug the charger in. He has a collection of different adapters from previous trips. He wants to get his
charger plugged in with a minimum number of adapters (ideally none).

You have to write a function adapter_chain(adapters_info, charger_plug, wall_socket) that returns the shortest chain of
adapters required in order to connect the charger plug into the wall socket. The details of input and output follow.

Input:
adapters_info is the string representation of a directed graph. The number of vertices is the total number of
plug/socket types in the world. For each plug adapter that Moss owns, there is an edge from the type of socket on the
adapter to the type of plug.
charger_plug is a natural number that specifies the type of plug on the laptop charger.
wall_socket is a number that specifies the type of socket on the wall.

Output:
The function must return a shortest list of types of adapter that, when connected in order (from left to right), the
charger can be connected to the wall socket. The list must always start with the type of plug on the charger and end
with the type of socket on the wall. If itâ€™s not possible to make a connection with (or without) the available adapters,
the function must return the string "CS Unplugged!" (without the quotes)."""
